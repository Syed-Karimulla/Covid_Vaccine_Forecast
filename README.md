     The Main aim of project is to analysing vaccines dataset to forecast required vaccines compare to manufacturing or available vaccines and by using this forecasting manufacturers may increase and decrease their manufacturing quantity.   
Since the beginning of the pandemic, the pharmaceutical companies have concentrated their efforts on developing a vaccine in record time to achieve COVID-19 containment. While some COVID-19 vaccines are in the final test phases, preparing and planning for mass immunization becomes extremely important. Nevertheless, several aspects are likely to influence the success of the COVID-19 immunization program. Defined to monitor and track the proper vaccine distribution conditions against the safe handling rules defined by vaccine producers enabling the awareness.        We present a system in which machine learning technology is used to guaranty data integrity and vaccination, manufacturing and Supply. Defined to monitor and track the proper vaccine distribution conditions against the safe handling rules defined by vaccine producers enabling the awareness.
